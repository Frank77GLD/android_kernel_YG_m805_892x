 * Interrupt architecture for the GIC:
 *
 * o There is one Interrupt Distributor, which receives interrupts
 *   from system devices and sends them to the Interrupt Controllers.
 *
 * o There is one CPU Interface per CPU, which sends interrupts sent
 *   by the Distributor, and interrupts generated locally, to the
 *   associated CPU. The base address of the CPU interface is usually
 *   aliased so that the same address points to different chips depending
 *   on the CPU it is accessed from.
 *
 * Note that IRQs 0-31 are special - they are local to each CPU.
 * As such, the enable set/clear, pending set/clear and active bit
 * registers are banked per-cpu for these sources.
